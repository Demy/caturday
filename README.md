You're playing as an Instagram modelling cat. 

## Moodlets
You can get a moodlet from using one of the objects in the room.

Come to the object and quickly hit the "E" key multiple times filling the progress bar.

You can only have 2 moodlets at the same time.

## Instagram mode
### Poses
You will get the image of the pose your owner wants to shoot on the top-left corner of the screen.

You can strike the pose by quickly hitting the key button that's specified on the pose image.

To finalize the pose, hit the "W" key or you will start loosing the pose progress.

### Pose and mood
You might be not in a quite mood for the pose. Near the pose image you will see the comment text showing whether this pose fits your moodlets or not. 

Keep in mind that in the bad mood for the pose you'll make a bad shot even if the pose was made perfectly well.

### Refusing the pose
If you don't like the pose (your current mood is off or you just like to see the kitty being grumpy) you can refuse to strike it. On the top-right corner of the screen you will see the "Struggle" image and the keys you need to press to quit the photo set. 

You need to follow the key squence (the image will be changing for each key pressed) to fill the Struggle progress bar.

## Profile
In the cat's room you can see your profile with all your like, followers and achievements by pressing "P" key. 

## FAQ

### How do I know which moodlets are good?
The poses are chosen by random and you can't guess the next one, but you can find the best moodlets for each pose. 

Choose the moodltes you think fit to the pose you have in mind, and refuse to pose if you'll see another request in the Instagram scene.

### Likes and followers doesn't make sence!
Sometimes they do, some times they don't. I'm not a good game designer and was struggling to balance the game during the 3-days game jam. 

Just keep in mind most of the design decisions were done in a big hurry. 


*This game is not perfect but I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I enjoyed writing it!
